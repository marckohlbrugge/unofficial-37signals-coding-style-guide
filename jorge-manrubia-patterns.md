## Code Review Philosophy

### Question Everything, Suggest Gently

**Pattern**: Jorge doesn't mandate changes - he questions and offers alternatives.

```
"For your consideration, I'd consider introducing a proper object..."
"I think you could remove these..."
"What do you think of naming this..."
```

**Why it matters**: Creates collaborative atmosphere, teaches decision-making, not just solutions.

**PR #929**: Multiple back-and-forth discussions about quota design, each building on previous feedback.

---

### Public vs Private Surface Area

**Pattern**: Aggressively minimize public methods.

```ruby
# Bad - exposes internal details
class Quota
  def reset_quota
  def check_if_due_for_reset
  def calculate_usage
end

# Good - narrow public API
class Quota
  def spend(cost)
  def ensure_not_depleted

  private
    def reset_if_due
    def depleted?
end
```

**PR #929 feedback**:
> "I'd use the rule of not adding public methods that are not used anywhere. The narrower the public surface of a class the better, since it's easier to grasp its responsibilities at a glance."

**Why it matters**:
- Easier to understand class responsibilities
- Signals internal vs external concerns
- Prevents coupling

---

### Domain-Driven Naming

**Pattern**: Choose names that reflect business reality, not implementation.

**PR #929 examples**:

```ruby
# Jorge's suggestion: treat quota as something you "spend"
quota.spend(cost)           # not increment_usage(cost)
quota.ensure_not_depleted   # not ensure_under_limit
quota.depleted?             # not over_limit?

# Reasoning: "A quota is something you spend until you don't have anything left"
```

**Why it matters**: Code reads like the domain experts talk about it.

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Introduce Proper Objects When State Couples

**Pattern**: When parameters get passed through multiple method layers, extract an object.

**PR #929 - Before (code smell)**:
```ruby
def cost(within:)
  # ...
end

def cost_microcents(within:)
  # ...
end

def limit_cost(within:)
  # ...
end
```

**Jorge's feedback**:
> "The `limit` param results in having to pass it down the pipeline to several other methods. The shared param is often a smell that something is missing."

**After - Extracted `Ai::Quota` model**:
```ruby
class Ai::Quota < ApplicationRecord
  def spend(cost)
  def ensure_not_depleted
  def reset_if_due
end
```

**Why it matters**:
- Eliminates parameter coupling
- Encapsulates related behavior
- Creates clear ownership of concepts

**From PR #929**: Quota went from concern with shared params → proper AR model with full lifecycle.

---

### Custom Types: Only When Justified

**Pattern**: Consider custom Active Model types, but weigh the cost.

**PR #929 discussion** about `Money` type:

Jorge initially suggested custom Active Model type:
```ruby
# Could be done with custom type
class MoneyType < ActiveModel::Type::Value
  def cast(value)
    # handle "$100", 100, BigDecimal...
  end
end

attribute :limit, :money_type
attribute :used, :money_type
```

But then reconsidered:
> "The more I think about this, the more I feel that doing this conversion like this is totally fine. I feel like the whole custom type / accessor thing for money is too much."

**Final approach - Value object**:
```ruby
class Ai::Quota::Money < Data.define(:value)
  MICROCENTS_PER_DOLLAR = 100 * 1_000_000

  def self.wrap(value)
    case value
    when String then convert_dollars_to_microcents(BigDecimal(value[NUMBER_REGEX]))
    when Integer then new(value)
    # ...
    end
  end

  def in_microcents
    value
  end

  def in_dollars
    in_microcents.to_d / MICROCENTS_PER_DOLLAR
  end
end

# Usage
quota.spend(Money.wrap("$5.00"))
message.cost.in_dollars
```

**Why this approach won**:
- Money conversion only happens in one place (`Ai::Quota`)
- Value object encapsulates arithmetic
- Avoids framework overhead
- Fixed-point arithmetic (no float errors)

**Decision criteria**:
> "If we kept messing around with quota amounts in several other places in the app, then the custom type could be justified. But I think the current approach is simple enough."

---

### Concerns: Public Behavior Only

**Pattern**: Don't extract concerns containing only private methods.

**PR #929**:
```ruby
# Initial attempt - concern with reset logic
module Ai::Quota::Resettable
  private
    def reset_if_due
    def due_for_reset?
end

# Jorge's feedback:
# "We normally don't extract concerns that only contains private methods."

# Final - inlined into main class
class Ai::Quota
  def spend(cost)
    reset_if_due
    increment!(:used, cost.in_microcents)
  end

  private
    def reset_if_due
      reset if due_for_reset?
    end
end
```

**Rule**:
- **Concern**: Auxiliary public traits (Attachable, Named, Mentionable)
- **Private methods**: Inline in main class unless very large

---

### Wrapping Methods: Hide or Reveal?

**Pattern**: Consider whether wrapping methods hide useful details or just add noise.

**PR #929 - Jorge changed his mind mid-review**:

Initial thought:
```ruby
# Wrapper seems noisy
user.ensure_ai_quota_not_depleted
user.spend_ai_quota(cost)

# Direct access cleaner?
user.ai_quota.ensure_not_depleted
user.ai_quota.spend(cost)
```

Then reconsidered:
> "Sorry, I notice now that the wrapping methods were dealing with the 'lazy creation' of AI quota. I think it's fine as it was 👍"

**Final pattern**:
```ruby
module User::AiQuota
  def spend_ai_quota(cost)
    fetch_or_create_ai_quota.spend(cost)
  end

  private
    def fetch_or_create_ai_quota
      ai_quota || create_ai_quota!(limit: DEFAULT_QUOTA)
    end
end
```

**Why it matters**: Lazy initialization is internal detail worth hiding.

---

## Performance Patterns

### Memoize in Hot Paths

**Pattern**: Cache method results that are called repeatedly during rendering.

**PR #1052**:
```ruby
# Before - called many times during page render
def as_params
  {}.tap do |params|
    params[:indexed_by] = indexed_by
    params[:sorted_by] = sorted_by
    # ... many queries ...
  end
end

# After
def as_params
  @as_params ||= {}.tap do |params|
    params[:indexed_by] = indexed_by
    # ...
  end
end
```

**Jorge's note**: "This method is invoked many times during a page rendering and it triggers many queries (which will be cached, but we can save that with memoization)"

**Why it matters**: Even query cache has overhead - better to call once.

---

### Template Caching Strategy

**Pattern**: Layer caching at multiple levels - HTTP, template fragments, queries.

**PR #1052 - Timeline caching**:

```ruby
# Controller - HTTP caching
class EventsController
  def index
    fresh_when @day_timeline
  end
end

# View - shared across users
<% cache [ user, filter, day.to_date, events ], "day-timeline" do %>
  <%= render "columns" %>
<% end %>

# Partial - filter menu cached per user
<% cache [ user, filter, expanded? ], "user-filtering" do %>
  <%= render "filters/menu" %>
<% end %>
```

**Jorge's comment**:
> "I cached the filter menu since it implies rendering a bunch of templates and triggering many queries. The cache won't be shared across users, but it will be reused essentially in every rendered screen on a per-user basis."

**Caching layers**:
1. **HTTP cache** - Full response (via `fresh_when`)
2. **Column cache** - Shared across users with same events
3. **Filter menu** - Per-user, reused across pages
4. **Timezone** - Added to etag for user-specific rendering

**Why it matters**:
- Identify what varies (user, data, time)
- Cache at the right granularity
- Reuse fragments across requests

---

### Guard Against Token Limits

**Pattern**: When integrating with LLMs, count tokens before sending.

**PR #483** - Donal's feedback on embeddings:
```ruby
# Need to truncate to token limit
module Searchable
  def embedding_input
    truncated_to_token_limit(text_for_embedding)
  end

  private
    def truncated_to_token_limit(text)
      tokenizer = Tiktoken.encoding_for_model("text-embedding-3-small")
      tokens = tokenizer.encode(text)

      # Subtract buffer for safety
      max_tokens = 8096 - 20

      if tokens.length > max_tokens
        tokenizer.decode(tokens.first(max_tokens))
      else
        text
      end
    end
end
```

**Why it matters**: API will reject over-limit requests; better to truncate gracefully.

---

## Testing Patterns

### VCR for External APIs

**Pattern**: Record real API responses, replay in tests.

**PR #483** - AI translation tests:

```ruby
# test/test_helper.rb
VCR.configure do |config|
  config.cassette_library_dir = "test/vcr_cassettes"
  config.hook_into :webmock
  config.filter_sensitive_data('<API_KEY>') { Rails.application.credentials.openai.api_key }
end

# test/models/command/ai/translator_test.rb
class Command::Ai::TranslatorTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test "filter by assignments" do
    VCR.use_cassette("translator/filter_by_assignments") do
      result = Command::Ai::Translator.new("cards assigned to jz").translate
      assert_equal "jz", result.context[:assignees].first
    end
  end
end
```

**To update cassettes**: `VCR_RECORD=1 bin/rails test`

**Why it matters**:
- Fast tests (no network calls)
- Deterministic (same response every time)
- Works offline
- Documents actual API responses

---

### Development Tests OK

**Pattern**: It's fine to commit WIP tests, clean up before merge.

**PR #483 - Jorge's comment**:
```ruby
# test/models/command/chat_query_test.rb
# > "This is a test I created for development purposes, I'll nix and create a proper suite"
```

**Why it matters**: Tests evolve with the feature; exploration tests help thinking.

---

## Rails Patterns

### Data.define for Value Objects

**Pattern**: Use Ruby 3.2's `Data.define` for immutable value objects.

**PR #929**:
```ruby
class Ai::Quota::Money < Data.define(:value)
  def self.wrap(value)
    new(convert(value))
  end

  def in_dollars
    value.to_d / MICROCENTS_PER_DOLLAR
  end
end

# Usage
money = Money.wrap("$100")
money.value        # => 10000000000 (microcents)
money.in_dollars   # => 100.0
```

**Benefits over Struct**:
- Immutable by default
- Pattern matching support
- Cleaner syntax

---

### Fixed-Point Arithmetic for Money

**Pattern**: Store money as integers (microcents) to avoid float errors.

**PR #929 discussion**:

```ruby
# Why not DECIMAL column?
# SQLite's DECIMAL is backed by float:
sqlite> SELECT (0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1) - 0.3 as difference;
5.55111512312578e-17

# Solution: INTEGER column with fixed-point conversion
class Ai::Quota::Money
  CENTS_PER_DOLLAR = 100
  MICROCENTS_PER_CENT = 1_000_000
  MICROCENTS_PER_DOLLAR = CENTS_PER_DOLLAR * MICROCENTS_PER_CENT

  def self.convert_dollars_to_microcents(dollars)
    (dollars.to_d * MICROCENTS_PER_DOLLAR).round.to_i
  end
end
```

**Why microcents, not cents?**
- LLM costs are fractions of a cent ($0.00001 per token)
- Microcents give 6 decimal places of precision

---

### Time-Based Reset Without Cron

**Pattern**: Check and reset on use, not scheduled job.

**PR #929**:
```ruby
class Ai::Quota
  def spend(cost)
    transaction do
      reset_if_due
      increment!(:used, cost.in_microcents)
    end
  end

  private
    def reset_if_due
      reset if due_for_reset?
    end

    def due_for_reset?
      reset_at.before?(Time.current)
    end

    def reset
      update(used: 0, reset_at: 7.days.from_now)
    end
end
```

**Jorge's feedback on cron approach**:
> "As I was working on this I noticed that we can get by without the Cron job by checking if the quota has to be reset when its incremented. This simplifies things a bit."

**Why it matters**:
- One less moving part
- Resets happen exactly when needed
- No scheduler dependency

---

### Error Handling: Specific Errors

**Pattern**: Define custom errors for business rules.

**PR #929**:
```ruby
class Ai::Quota
  class UsageExceedsQuotaError < StandardError; end

  def ensure_not_depleted
    reset_if_due
    raise UsageExceedsQuotaError if depleted?
  end
end

# Controller
rescue_from Ai::Quota::UsageExceedsQuotaError do
  render json: { error: "You've depleted your quota" },
         status: :too_many_requests
end
```

**Why it matters**:
- Specific rescue blocks
- Clear intent
- HTTP status codes match business rules

---

### JavaScript Error Handling

**Pattern**: Parse error responses, show descriptive messages.

**PR #929**:
```javascript
// conversation/composer_controller.js
async #failPendingMessage(clientMessageId, response) {
  let errorMessage = null

  if (response?.contentType?.includes('application/json')) {
    const error = JSON.parse(await response.responseText)
    errorMessage = error.error
  }

  this.conversationMessagesOutlet.failPendingMessage(
    clientMessageId,
    errorMessage
  )
}
```

```css
/* Show error as data attribute */
.conversation__message--failed[data-error]::after {
  color: var(--color-negative);
  content: attr(data-error);
  display: block;
}
```

**Why it matters**: Users see "You've depleted your quota" not generic "Error occurred".

---

## Decision-Making Process

### Extract Only When Justified

**Pattern**: Jorge models his thinking process out loud.

**PR #929 progression**:
1. "The limit param is a smell that something is missing"
2. "Thinking about how to clarify this, my mind goes to having a new record"
3. "This way you remove the responsibility of tracking AI quotas from conversation"

**Teaching moment**: Shows *why* extraction helps, not just *what* to extract.

---

### Reconsider Based on New Information

**Pattern**: Jorge often changes recommendations as discussion evolves.

**PR #929 - Money type decision**:
- First: "Could we clarify this with an object?"
- Then: "You could use a custom Active Model type"
- Finally: "I think it's good as it is... the current approach is simple enough"

**Why it matters**:
- No ego in code review
- Models learning process
- Best solution emerges through discussion

---

### The "Few Lines of Code" Heuristic

**Pattern**: Default to fewer lines unless more are clearly justified.

**PR #929**:
> "My rule of thumb is that the fewer lines of code the better, but of course, it's a fine line without absolute truths (sometimes the extra lines are justified). You have a much better sense of the problems with amounts here so follow your instinct 👍"

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Narrow public APIs** - Only expose what's actually used
2. **Domain names over technical** - `depleted?` not `over_limit?`
3. **Objects emerge from coupling** - Shared params → extract object
4. **Memoize hot paths** - Methods called during rendering
5. **Layer caching** - HTTP, templates, queries
6. **Fixed-point for money** - Integers, not floats
7. **Reset on use, not cron** - Simpler, more reliable
8. **VCR for APIs** - Fast, deterministic tests
9. **Custom types: only when spread** - If used in one place, value object is enough
10. **Teach through questions** - "What do you think of..." not "Change this to..."
