# Rails Notification System Patterns: Lessons from Fizzy

This document extracts transferable notification system patterns from Fizzy's implementation. Focus is on architecture, batching strategies, user preferences, and background job patterns that can be applied to any Rails app.

---

## 1. Read State Management with Timestamps

**Pattern**: Use `read_at` timestamps instead of boolean `read` flags.

**Why it matters**: Timestamps provide both state AND temporal information, enabling time-based queries and analytics without additional columns.

```ruby
# From PR #208
class Notification < ApplicationRecord
  scope :unread, -> { where(read_at: nil) }
  scope :read, -> { where.not(read_at: nil) }
  scope :ordered, -> { order(read_at: :desc, created_at: :desc) }

  def read?
    read_at.present?
  end

  def self.read_all
    update!(read_at: Time.current)
  end

  def read
    update!(read_at: Time.current)
  end
end
```

**Benefits**:
- Know WHEN something was read, not just IF it was read
- Enables "show me notifications read in the last week" type queries
- Supports features like "mark as unread" (just nil out the timestamp)
- Trivial to upgrade from boolean (add timestamp, backfill with `created_at` for read items)

---

## 2. Notification Bundling with Time Windows

**Pattern**: Bundle notifications into time windows rather than linking individual notifications to bundles.

**Why it matters**: Lightweight, immutable design that avoids complex many-to-many relationships.

```ruby
# From PR #974
class Notification::Bundle < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user

  enum :status, %i[ pending processing delivered ]

  scope :due, -> { pending.where("ends_at <= ?", Time.current) }
  scope :containing, ->(notification) {
    where("starts_at <= ? AND ends_at > ?", notification.created_at, notification.created_at)
  }

  # Query notifications in the window dynamically - no foreign keys needed!
  def notifications
    user.notifications.where(created_at: window).unread
  end

  private
    def window
      starts_at..ends_at
    end
end
```

**Key insights**:
- No foreign key from Notification to Bundle (simpler schema)
- Notifications are immutable, so querying by time window is reliable
- Window boundaries prevent overlaps (enforced via validation)
- Status enum tracks lifecycle: `pending` → `processing` → `delivered`

**Validation to prevent overlapping bundles**:
```ruby
# From PR #974
validate :validate_no_overlapping

def validate_no_overlapping
  if overlapping_bundles.exists?
    errors.add(:base, "Bundle window overlaps with an existing pending bundle")
  end
end

def overlapping_bundles
  user.notification_bundles
    .where.not(id: id)
    .overlapping_with(self)
end
```

## 3. User Preference Architecture with Settings Model

**Pattern**: Extract user settings into a separate model rather than adding columns to User.

**Why it matters**: Keeps User model focused, makes settings easier to test, and enables settings-specific logic.

```ruby
# From PR #974
module User::Configurable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    has_one :settings, class_name: "User::Settings", dependent: :destroy
    after_create :create_settings, unless: :system?
  end
end

class User::Settings < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user

  enum :bundle_email_frequency, %i[ never every_few_hours daily weekly ],
    default: :every_few_hours, prefix: :bundle_email

  # Settings-specific business logic lives here
  def bundle_aggregation_period
    case bundle_email_frequency
    when "every_few_hours" then 4.hours
    when "daily" then 1.day
    when "weekly" then 1.week
    else 1.day
    end
  end

  def bundling_emails?
    !bundle_email_never?
  end
end
```

**Benefits**:
- Avoids bloating User table with preference columns
- Settings logic is encapsulated and testable
- Easy to add new settings without touching User model
- Clean separation of concerns

**Reactive settings changes**:
```ruby
# From PR #974
after_update :review_pending_bundles, if: :saved_change_to_bundle_email_frequency?

def review_pending_bundles
  if bundling_emails?
    flush_pending_bundles  # Deliver all pending
  else
    cancel_pending_bundles  # Delete all pending
  end
end
```

---

## 4. Automatic Bundling via Callbacks

**Pattern**: Automatically bundle new notifications via `after_create` callback.

**Why it matters**: Zero-touch bundling - developers creating notifications don't need to remember to bundle.

```ruby
# From PR #974
class Notification < ApplicationRecord
  after_create :bundle

  private
    def bundle
      user.bundle(self) if user.settings.bundling_emails?
    end
end

module User::Notifiable
  def bundle(notification)
    transaction do
      find_or_create_bundle_for(notification)
    end
  end

  private
    def find_or_create_bundle_for(notification)
      find_bundle_for(notification) || create_bundle_for(notification)
    end

    def find_bundle_for(notification)
      notification_bundles.pending.containing(notification).last
    end

    def create_bundle_for(notification)
      notification_bundles.create!(starts_at: notification.created_at)
    end
end
```

**Key insight**: Bundle creation is idempotent - finds existing bundle in same time window or creates new one.

---

## 5. Background Job Pattern for Batch Delivery

**Pattern**: Use nested jobs - one coordinator job that spawns individual delivery jobs.

**Why it matters**: Parallelizes delivery while managing memory and avoiding timeouts.

```ruby
# From PR #974
class Notification::Bundle::DeliverAllJob < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :backend

  def perform
    ApplicationRecord.with_each_tenant do |tenant|
      Notification::Bundle.deliver_all
    end
  end
end

class Notification::Bundle
  def self.deliver_all
    due.in_batches do |batch|
      jobs = batch.collect { DeliverJob.new(it) }
      ActiveJob.perform_all_later jobs  # Bulk enqueue for efficiency
    end
  end
end

class Notification::Bundle::DeliverJob < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :backend

  def perform(bundle)
    bundle.deliver
  end
end
```

**Benefits**:
- Coordinator job handles multi-tenancy and batching logic
- Individual delivery jobs are small, fast, and retriable
- `perform_all_later` bulk-enqueues for better performance
- Easy to monitor/retry individual deliveries

**Recurring job configuration**:
```yaml
# config/recurring.yml (Solid Queue)
deliver_bundled_notifications:
  command: "Notification::Bundle.deliver_all_later"
  schedule: every 30 minutes
```

---

## 6. Turbo Streams for Real-Time Notification UI

**Pattern**: Broadcast notification changes to update UI across all user's tabs.

**Why it matters**: Notifications stay in sync across browser tabs without polling.

```ruby
# From PR #475
class Notification < ApplicationRecord
  after_create_commit :broadcast_unread

  def read
    update!(read_at: Time.current)
    broadcast_read  # Added in PR #475
  end

  private
    def broadcast_unread
      broadcast_prepend_to user, :notifications, target: "notifications"
    end

    def broadcast_read
      broadcast_remove_to user, :notifications
    end
end
```

**View setup**:
```erb
<%= turbo_stream_from Current.user, :notifications %>

<dialog id="notification-tray">
  <%= turbo_frame_tag "notifications", src: tray_notifications_path %>
</dialog>
```

**Key insight**: Broadcasting on `read` ensures that marking a notification as read in one tab removes it from the tray in all tabs.

---

## 7. Pagination with Infinite Scroll via Intersection Observer

**Pattern**: Use Stimulus controller with IntersectionObserver for automatic pagination.

**Why it matters**: Progressive loading without "Load More" buttons or complex state management.

```javascript
// From PR #208
import { Controller } from "@hotwired/stimulus"
import { get } from "@rails/request.js"

export default class extends Controller {
  static values = { url: String }

  connect() {
    this.#observe()
  }

  #observe() {
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
      const visible = !!entries.find(entry => entry.isIntersecting)
      if (visible) {
        this.#fetch()
      }
    })

    observer.observe(this.element)
  }

  #fetch() {
    get(this.urlValue, { responseKind: "turbo-stream" })
  }
}
```

**View usage**:
```erb
<!-- From PR #208 -->
<%= tag.div id: "next_page", data: {
  controller: "fetch-on-visible",
  fetch_on_visible_url_value: notifications_path(page: @page.next_param)
} %>
```

**Controller response**:
```ruby
def index
  set_page_and_extract_portion_from Current.user.notifications.read.ordered

  respond_to do |format|
    format.turbo_stream if current_page_param  # Pagination requests
    format.html  # Initial page load
  end
end
```

---

## 8. Client-Side Notification Grouping

**Pattern**: Group notifications by subject (e.g., card) on the client side with Stimulus.

**Why it matters**: Reduces clutter in notification tray, works dynamically with new notifications.

```javascript
// From PR #1448
export default class extends Controller {
  static targets = [ "notification", "hiddenNotifications" ]
  static classes = [ "grouped" ]

  connect() {
    this.group()
  }

  // Group existing notifications on initial load
  group() {
    const notificationsByCardId = this.#groupNotificationsByCardId()

    for (const cardId in notificationsByCardId) {
      const notifications = notificationsByCardId[cardId]
      if (notifications.length > 1) {
        this.#renderGroup(notifications)
      }
    }

    this.grouped = true
  }

  // Group new notifications as they arrive via Turbo Streams
  notificationTargetConnected(notification) {
    if (this.grouped && notification.parentElement !== this.hiddenNotificationsTarget) {
      this.#groupNotification(notification)
    }
  }

  #renderGroup(groupedNotifications) {
    // Sort by timestamp, show oldest first
    groupedNotifications.sort((a, b) =>
      parseInt(a.dataset.timestamp) - parseInt(b.dataset.timestamp)
    )

    // Show first notification with count badge
    this.#showAsGrouped(groupedNotifications[0], groupedNotifications.length)

    // Hide the rest
    groupedNotifications.slice(1).forEach(n => this.#hideInGroup(n))
  }

  #setGroupCount(notification, count) {
    notification.querySelector("[data-group-count]").textContent = count
  }
}
```

**Why client-side grouping?**:
- Works dynamically with real-time notifications arriving via Turbo Streams
- Server-side grouping is complex when notifications have polymorphic sources
- Avoids database queries to unify notifications by subject
- UI-only concern - no need to persist grouping state

---

## 9. RESTful Controller Design for Notification Actions

**Pattern**: Model notification actions as resources with dedicated controllers.

**Why it matters**: Follows Rails conventions, clearer routing, easier to test.

```ruby
# From PR #405 - Refactored from custom actions to resourceful routes

# BEFORE: Custom actions on NotificationsController
post "notifications/:id/mark_read"
post "notifications/mark_all_read"

# AFTER: RESTful resources
resources :notifications, only: [:index] do
  resource :reading, only: [:create], module: :notifications
end
namespace :notifications do
  resource :readings, only: [] do
    post :create_all
  end
end

# Dedicated controllers
class Notifications::ReadingsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @notification = Current.user.notifications.find(params[:id])
    @notification.read
  end

  def create_all
    Current.user.notifications.unread.read_all
    redirect_to notifications_path
  end
end
```

**Benefits**:
- `readings` resource models "the act of reading"
- Clearer intent: creating a reading vs. marking as read
- Easier to add before/after actions specific to reading
- Follows REST principles

---

## 10. Email Unsubscribe with Signed Tokens

**Pattern**: Use Rails 7.1+ `generates_token_for` for secure, self-contained unsubscribe links.

**Why it matters**: Stateless tokens that expire automatically, no database lookups needed for validation.

```ruby
# From PR #974
module User::Notifiable
  included do
    generates_token_for :unsubscribe, expires_in: 1.month
  end
end

class Notification::BundleMailer < ApplicationMailer
  include Mailers::Unsubscribable

  def notification(bundle)
    @user = bundle.user
    @unsubscribe_token = @user.generate_token_for(:unsubscribe)

    mail to: bundle.user.email_address, subject: "Latest Activity"
  end
end

module Mailers::Unsubscribable
  included do
    after_action :set_unsubscribe_headers
  end

  def set_unsubscribe_headers
    headers["List-Unsubscribe-Post"] = "List-Unsubscribe=One-Click"
    headers["List-Unsubscribe"] = "<#{notifications_unsubscribe_url(access_token: @unsubscribe_token)}>"
  end
end
```

**Unsubscribe controller**:
```ruby
# From PR #974
class Notifications::UnsubscribesController < ApplicationController
  allow_unauthenticated_access
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

  before_action :set_user

  def create
    @user.settings.bundle_email_never!
    redirect_to notifications_unsubscribe_path(access_token: params[:access_token])
  end

  private
    def set_user
      unless @user = User.find_by_token_for(:unsubscribe, params[:access_token])
        redirect_to root_path, alert: "Invalid unsubscribe link"
      end
    end
end
```

**Key features**:
- RFC-compliant `List-Unsubscribe` headers for email clients
- Self-expiring tokens (no manual cleanup needed)
- Works without authentication session
- CSRF protection skipped (POST with signed token is sufficient)

---

## 11. Email Layout with Inline Styles

**Pattern**: Use table-based layout with inline styles for email compatibility.

**Why it matters**: Ensures emails render consistently across all email clients.

```erb
<!-- From PR #974 -->
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="avatar__container">
      <%= mail_avatar_tag(notification.creator) %>
    </td>
    <td>
      <%= render "notification/bundle_mailer/#{notification.source_type.underscore}/body",
                 notification: notification %>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

**CSS in layout**:
```html
<style>
  .avatar__container {
    vertical-align: top;
    width: 3em;
  }

  .notification__author {
    font-size: 0.8em;
    opacity: 0.66;
    margin: 0;
  }
</style>
```

**Group notifications by subject in email** (PR #1574):
```erb
<!-- Aggregate by card to reduce email clutter -->
<% @notifications.group_by(&:card).each do |card, notifications| %>
  <h2 class="notification__board"><%= card.board.name %></h2>
  <%= link_to "##{ card.id } #{ card.title }", card, class: "card__title" %>
  <%= render partial: "notification/bundle_mailer/notification",
             collection: notifications, as: :notification %>
<% end %>
```

---

## 12. Testing Notification Delivery

**Pattern**: Test time windows, bundling behavior, and state transitions.

```ruby
# From PR #974
class Notification::BundleTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  setup do
    @user = users(:david)
    @user.settings.bundle_email_every_few_hours!
  end

  test "notifications are bundled within the aggregation period" do
    notification_1 = assert_difference -> { @user.notification_bundles.pending.count }, 1 do
      @user.notifications.create!(source: events(:logo_published), creator: @user)
    end

    travel_to 3.hours.from_now

    notification_2 = assert_no_difference -> { @user.notification_bundles.count } do
      @user.notifications.create!(source: events(:logo_published), creator: @user)
    end

    travel_to 3.days.from_now

    notification_3 = assert_difference -> { @user.notification_bundles.pending.count }, 1 do
      @user.notifications.create!(source: events(:logo_published), creator: @user)
    end

    bundle_1, bundle_2 = @user.notification_bundles.last(2)
    assert_includes bundle_1.notifications, notification_1
    assert_includes bundle_1.notifications, notification_2
    assert_includes bundle_2.notifications, notification_3
  end

  test "overlapping bundles are invalid" do
    bundle_1 = @user.notification_bundles.create!(
      starts_at: Time.current,
      ends_at: 1.hour.from_now
    )

    bundle_2 = @user.notification_bundles.build(
      starts_at: 30.minutes.from_now,
      ends_at: 90.minutes.from_now
    )

    assert_not bundle_2.valid?
    assert_includes bundle_2.errors[:base], "Bundle window overlaps with an existing pending bundle"
  end
end
```

**Key testing insights**:
- Use `travel_to` to test time-based bundling
- Test both positive (included) and negative (excluded) cases
- Verify window overlap validations
- Test settings changes trigger appropriate actions
